BE4 aka BattleExit 4
===

This is a little helper program to install along side DICE's Battlefield 4. 
Selecting "quit" while in game or hitting ALT-F4 will still hang the program instead of close it. 
It is thus easier to alt-tab and kill via task manager. This little program provides a simple shortcut 
that is both tangible and satisfying, and does the same thing - closes the program.
